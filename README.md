# TestingIPFS
A script to send asynchronous requests to an AMQP Server for Load Testing of IPFS integration to a blockchain platform.
Here instead of file we are sending a random strings of characters for testing purpose.
The response time is calculated using values from response and exported to a csv file.
This file can be used to determine mean response time of IPFS integration.
